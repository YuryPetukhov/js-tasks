We need an I variable to save index (start), need two pointers K(iterate through target string) and J(iterate throw subString), which should start from 0 (the first char)
while loop which should iterate through the target string, and inner loop which should works until K pointer and J pointer are equal, during pointers are equal we should increment their and check if j === needle.length it means we iterated through all substring and all chars are equal, we should return index(i), if not move index +1 and start the search from i (k = i) and reset j to 0 (need start from the start of substring)
